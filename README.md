Hello!

I am a software developer and researcher.

As a software developer, I like learning and using diverse languages and writing reliable and understandable code.

As a researcher, I am interested in [mathematical
modeling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model), [systems
theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_theory),
[scheduling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheduling_(computing)),
[optimization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization), and
[formal methods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_methods).
